# S3 (Simple Storage Service)

* **Object-based storage** (store files, as opposed to OS/DB/app which goes in **block storage - EBS**)
* Unlimited storage, each file 0-5TB
* Files stored in buckets - folder with universal namespace (name must be unique globally)
* URL format https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/bucket_name
* HTTP code 200 when upload is successful

Global view in console. Buckets are deployed to a region.

Objects are private by default, if bucket is left private when created.
To make objects public, the entire bucket can be made "can be public" prior.

Can enable multipart upload for faster upload.

Read the [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/)

## Data consistency

* Immediate consistency for PUTS of new objects
* Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (takes a little time)

## Key-Value Store
S3 is object based. Objects have:

* Key (name of file)
* Value (sequence of bytes)
* Version ID
* Metadata
* Subresources: ACL, policies, torrent

## Tiered storage

* S3 standard: HA - can sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently. Only S3 service with no retrieval fee. Availabilty 99.99%, Durability 99.999999999%
* S3 IA (infrequently accessed): for files not frequently accessed that require rapid access. Lower fee but retrieval fee.
* S3 Reduced Redundancy (One Zone IA): Lower cost than IA but less resilience
* Glacier: archival only. Retrieval time 3-5h for standard. Can be expedited, bulk or std.

## Charges

* storage per Gb
* requests per number of requests
* storage mgmt pricing (metadata)
* data transfer (across regions)
* transfer acceleration (uses CloudFront for fast transfer across regions)

## Encryption

Client side
Server side
  - S3 Managed keys (SSE-S3)
  - KMS (SSE-KMS)
  - Custom Provider Keys (SSE-C)

## Versioning

Properties > Versioning > Enable versioning
Once enabled, it can be suspended but not disabled.
Each latest version is made private (even if file was made public previously)
Each version takes space (which we have to pay for)

With versioning on, when deleting a file a "delete marker" is created and it shows along with all the versions of the file.
To restore deleted file, delete the "delete marker".
Object versions keep permissions (e.g. if it used to be public and is restored, it will be public)

MFA can be enabled to restrict deletion.

Integrates with lifecycle rules

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectVersioning.html

## Lifecycle management

With or without versioning.

Automation to expire or transition to other S3 tiers.
Bucket > mgmt > lifecycle
Can transition both current and/or previous verions.

Transition to *where* after *how many days*
Expire (delete) after *how many days*

From S3 to glacier can be moved the day after uploading.
From S3 to IA has to be 30 days after creation.
From IA to Glacier has to be 30 days after moving to IA.

## Cross-region replication

Create new bucket. Versioning must be enabled in both source and destination. Regions must be unique.
Go to original bucket > mgmt > replication. Creates role for CRR.
New objects and modifications are automatically replicated.
To replicate original objects, use CLI: `aws s3 cp --recursive s3://source-bucket s3://destination-bucket`
Object deletions are not automatically replicated.

Cannot replicate multiple buckets or daisy-chaining.


## Bucket security

### Bucket policies
### Policies

all objects are private when created by default
access logs can be created for auditing

### Encryption
* In transit: SSL/TLS
* At rest
  - Server side
    - S3 managed keys SSE-S3
    - KMS managed keys SSE-KMS (with audit trail)
    - Customer provided keys SSE-C
  - Client side (encrypted before uploading to bucket)

# Storage gateway

On-prem virtual appliance to connect to AWS.

* File Gateway (NFS mountpoint) for **flat files** stored in S3, allows versioning, lifecycle mgmt, etc
* Volumes gateway (iSCSI) **block based** storage as disk volumes (virtual hard disks) EBS, allows snapshots.
  - stored volumes: (1Gb to 16Tb) virtual hard disk. all the data is stored locally, complete copy incrementally backed up to S3.
  - cached volumes: (1Gb to 32Tb) some data (i.e. frequently-used data) is stored locally, all the other data is in S3
* Tape gateway (VTL) backup/archiving virtual tapes can be sent to glacier. uses popular backup applications

# Snowball

Physical means to import/export to/from S3.

## Snowball
Hardware-secure applicance. Petabyte-scale data transport solution to transfer large amounts of data to AWS. i.e. how to load a lot of data into AWS bypassing the internet.
80TB

## Snowball edge
Like snowball with abit more storage and with compute capability.
Can be used as a portable data center of sorts (can run lambda).
100TB

## Snowmobile
100PB shipping container truck for Exa-scale data transfer.

## Import Export
Deprecated, preceded snowball. People sent in disks to amazon for them to load into aws.


# Transfer acceleration

Uses CloudFront edge network to accelerate uploads to S3.

# Hosting a website in S3

Very cheap. Can only host static websites. Serverless. Scales automatically if high demand!
